4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

Raffi and Cameron worked together to come up with the idea for the web app, what gestures to add, and what each gesture would do.

5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

Nope. 

--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?

We designed our app with a basic user in mind. Someone who would be able to easily use their hands in order to navigate the web app.
We also designed our app with a user who is generally knowledgeable about the Reddit App and different ways you can interact with reddit posts. 

7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.

The two custom gestures that we created were "One hand open, One hand closed" and "One hand open, One hand pointing".

8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?

Our app implents the following principles of good UI design by having a save and unsave gesture control, 
downvote and upvote gesture control, and the ability to move through posts. The users have complete control over the web app 
and what content they are viewing/interacting with, and it is a responsive mobile first design.
