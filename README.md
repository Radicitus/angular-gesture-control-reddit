# Gesteddit
Hi there!

Gesteddit is a **multimodal Angular web app** designed to be controlled by a **mouse** or by **hand gestures**. It makes use of **ML Image Recognition** via the **HandtrackJS** library to provide this functionality.

Here are some of features:

- A clean and reactive UI built with [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Custom gestures that trigger different UI controls
- State service for calling child component functions using **BehaviorSubject** from **RxJS**
- Dynamic object creation using data packaging with custom data containers from json returned by the RedditAPI
- Low resource consumption

Here's a peek at the [web app](https://youtu.be/6JZUj1elT1M).
